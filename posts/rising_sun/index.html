    <h1 id="the-rising-sun-the-decline--fall-of-the-japanese-empire-1936-45">The Rising Sun: The Decline &amp; Fall of the Japanese Empire, 1936-45</h1>
<p>Author: John Toland
Finished April 23rd, 2023</p>
<p>Overall comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Very compelling.  Sympathetic, perhaps overly so at times, to the Japanese, but it feels like a fair assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several unforced errors all the time in warfare on both sides</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both countries have strenuous conscientious objectors. In some ways the objectors, like Prince Konoye, are more courageous than those in the U.S. because there was imminent risk of assassination (&lsquo;gekokujo&rsquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obvious that the media grossly distorts accounts on both sides during the war</p>
<ul>
<li>The US reports fierce resistance in the e.g. Malaysia when really they were highly unprepared and fled</li>
<li>Japanese example:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Main questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What were the factors that lead Japan into World War II/conflict with the US?</li>
<li>What are the cultural differences between the US and Japan?</li>
<li>What does Japan’s early performance in the war have to teach us about wars in general?</li>
<li>How did Japanese public attitude change during times of war?</li>
<li>What role did energy insecurity play in causing conflict?</li>
<li>What led the war to end?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Various surprises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Japan&rsquo;s imperialism was triggered by the west (first with Commodore Perry then more broadly by mimicking western imperialism)</li>
<li>Japan wanted a racial equality clause in the Treaty of Versailles after WW1 but France, U.S., Britain etc opposed it</li>
<li>Gekokujo as a strengthening/volatile factor in Japanese decision making</li>
<li>Atomic bombs were not what</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="on-the-peculiarities-of-japanese-culture">On the peculiarities of Japanese culture:</h4>
<p><em>Gekokujo</em> or “the low bringing down the high“ was a cultural norm, whereby it was acceptable to have planned violence, even in the form of mass murders, for the greater glory of the nation. How was Japan unified in the first place? Wasn’t it feudal till very recently?</p>
<p>The May 15 incident is a good example whereby Prime Minister Inukai, a 75 your old man, who opposed the conquest of Manchuria, was killed by dozens of assassins. Nine young men asked to take the place of those on trial when they had nothing to do with the assassination, and to show the good faith and closed the nine little fingers pickled in a jar of alcohol. Such was the fanaticism of patriotic fervor.</p>
<p>It was a big factor leading to militarism and ultimately self-destructive nationalism; the testosterone-filled young men were the ones who committed gekokujo</p>
<p><em>The importance of honor</em>. Forty seven ronin is a story enshrined in the Japanese mythos.
&ldquo;In the seventeenth century a provincial lord was so disgraced by Kira, the chief minister of the shogun, that he committed suicice. Oishi, a samurai warrior serving the dishonored man, vowed to avenge his death, and for the next seven years, he pretended, in the tradition of samurai sacrifice, to be a dissolute drunk while secretly planning revenge. Early one morning in a snowstorm, the forty-seven ronin (samurai who had lost their master&hellip;) raided the Kira home, not far from the Imperial Palace. They assassinated the chief minister, cut off his head and brought it to the temple where their master&rsquo;s ashes were enshrined. Then, in true bushido style, all forty-seven committed hara-kiri.</p>
<p><strong>Japan seems to have been a much more hated colonizer than the West.</strong>
In the Phillipines, the Americans were initially hated but after the years under Japanese rule were so enamored with the Americans that it was said a local leader pledged to work 365 days a year for free for the Americans. Very strong spirit of goodwill, especially for MacArthur</p>
<h4 id="the-state-of-japan-prior-to-ww2">The state of Japan prior to WW2</h4>
<p>Japan participated in international treaties and was a functioning member of the League of Nations. However, two key points of tension between Japan and the west was racial equality and Japanese expansion.</p>
<p>The Japanese often felt diminished and seen as lesser because of their race, and for good reason. At the 1919 Paris Peace conference, the Japanese were the only non-western of the five great powers. It called for a &lsquo;racial equality&rsquo; clause in the Versailles Peace Treaty but that was struck down by the other nations. Of course, the Japanese themselves were</p>
<p>The second point of tension was around Japanese colonialism. Prior to Commodore Perry&rsquo;s gunboat diplomacy, the Japanese had pursued a firmly isolationist policy, refusing to trade much with the outer world. After seeing the raw power of the U.S. gunboats, the Meiji restoration (1868) was the beginning of an intense period of trying to mimic the west. They sought to create a country that could withstand becoming a colony themselves. &ldquo;Rich country, strong military&rdquo; was such a slogan.
You can see the mimicry with the Japanese colonial policy. The recipe was take over local governments, start extracting natural resources to fuel expansion elsewhere.</p>
<p>Taiwan was taken in 1895 after the Japanese victory in the Sino-Japanese war. Korea became a protected by the Japanese after the Russo-Japanese war at the turn of the 20th century.</p>
<h4 id="on-the-factors-leading-to-japans-participation-in-wwii">On the factors leading to Japan&rsquo;s participation in WWII</h4>
<p>What was the state of Japanese</p>
<p>At the time of 1938, Japan had a lot of territory under her control. Manchuria, now, mostly a part of modern-day China, had become a Japanese territory?</p>
<p>The Marco Polo bridge incident.</p>
<p>It’s not entirely clear who, but surely either the Japanese expansionists looking to provoke Japanese invasion of China, or else, Chinese communists, hoping to start a full scale war between Chiang Kai Shek, and the Japanese.  But a third-party attempted to incite skirmishes between the local Chinese and Japanese, who are on good terms. It ended up serving as justification for the expansionists. </p>
<p>Communications were so bad that Tokyo had no idea the skirmish was being solved and demanded China recognize the local government</p>
<p>Ultimately reinforcements on trigger edge started shooting at each each other. Justification was protecting Japanese lives in Manchuria. They didn’t see it as declaring war with China but rather pushing for negotiation terms with Chiang. Officially they declared aims of achieving a new order and containing communism. Further, in the war, prince konoye , the Prime Minister, feared that uniting Asia was Japan’s last Hope for survival in the face of the Russo German pact. </p>
<p>What were the key events that took place in terms of conflict involving Japan in WWII?</p>
<ul>
<li>Japanese invasion of Manchuria</li>
<li>Japan joins Tripartite Pact</li>
<li>Phillippines</li>
<li>Pearl Harbor</li>
</ul>

<p>[To test my understanding of the book, I prompted ChatGPT in a mock interview format. You can try it yourself by modifying the prompt below]</p>
<p>You are a Jill Lepore, Professor of History and principal examiner for the PhD Final Public Oral defense that is about to occur. The candidate before you has written a dissertation about the role of Japan in the second world war. Your job is to ask questions to assess whether the candidate has a deep knowledge of their research.
The dissertation is entitled &ldquo;The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-45&rdquo;. It  chronicles the dramatic rise and fall of the Japanese empire, from the invasion of Manchuria and China to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, from the Japanese perspective. It examines the factors leading to the initial outbreak of war, the different cultural perspective between the US and Japan, as well as the factors&hellip;</p>
