    <h1 id="what-repositories-do-ml-practitioners-use-most-a-review-of-surveys">What repositories do ML practitioners use most?: A review of surveys</h1>
<p>As part of my quest to find the most important machine learning repositories, I wanted to find the repos that are used most frequently.</p>
<p>This post is my attempt to gauge the most popular libraries using direct surveys of people who do some type of work with machine learning. I start with the public survey data I could find before going into the private survey I did. Ultimately, I find that this approach can’t stand on its own, but that it is useful as a rapid initial look.</p>
<h3 id="public-survey-results">Public Survey Results</h3>
<p>It was pretty hard to find data about which machine learning repositories practitioners
use the most. A naive search turned up Buzzfeed-esque listicles with titles like
&lsquo;Top 10 Machine Learning Projects on Github&rsquo; from websites like analyticsvidhya.com
and analyticsindiamag.com[1]. I was hoping for a survey aggregating responses from
multiple people. The closest thing I could find was the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle-survey-2020">2020 Kaggle Developer Survey</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/kaggle_repo_use.png" alt="From Kaggle State of Machine Learning and Data Science 2020"></p>
<p>Note that the totals sum to more than 100% because the survey is multi-choice.</p>
<p>Kaggle is a company that charges companies to host data science competitions that solve a data science problem of theirs (Netflix famously had a $1M collaborative filtering algorithm <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data">challenge</a> in 2019)[3]. It is accordingly centered on ML engineers and data scientists, whom I care less about than researchers.</p>
<p>Scikit-learn, Keras, XGBoost, and LightGBM are are libraries that are designed for relatively standard classification and regression tasks. The popularity of these libraries on Kaggle suggest a heavy focus on model engineering and development, rather than novel research.</p>
<p>In looking through the rest of the survey I was surprised to learn that most Kaggle users come from India (~23%) and that the modal user had less than 2 years of experience in machine learning.</p>
<h3 id="private-survey-results">Private Survey Results</h3>
<p>I wanted another source of survey data, so I did a quick survey of eight ML practitioners[2]. Here is a chart of their responses.</p>
<p><img src="/ML_repo_use.png" alt="A survey of eight machine learning practitioners"></p>
<p>What are these packages?</p>
<p><em>PyTorch</em> and <em>TensorFlow</em> are used mainly for model specification.</p>
<p><em>NumPy</em> is used for manipulating tensors and arrays easily and efficiently.</p>
<p><em>Scikit-Learn</em> has many functions, but often it is used for pre-specified models that can be run with a single line.</p>
<p><em>Matplotlib, TensorBoard,</em> and <em>Weights and Biases</em> are used for visualizations. <em>Matplotlib</em> mainly for training data and model outputs. <em>TensorBoard</em> and <em>Weights and Biases</em> are more for experiment logging and visualizing network weights.</p>
<p><em>Jupyter notebook</em> is a simple development environment mainly used for quickly playing around with visualizations.</p>
<p><em>Hydra</em> is best for specifying complex model configurations (e.g. multiple jobs with different arguments).</p>
<p><em>Huggingface</em> is for easily manipulating language models.</p>
<p>Only responses that had more than one user were included in the bar graph. Other repositories mentioned were <em>pytorch_lightning, elasticsearch, s3, opencv, pyro, nltk, horovod, gym, e3nn, einops, grafana, biopython</em>.</p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>So what did I learn?</p>
<p>First, the lack of consensus between the Kaggle survey and my private survey suggests that I need to keep searching. The long tail of libraries mentioned only once is also strong evidence for this.</p>
<p>Also, I was surprised by the lack of public data about ML repository use. To me, this suggests that a little more digging might be useful after all.</p>
<p>Next, I plan to analyze the Github data pulled from collections of repositories like the Linux Foundation’s AI landscape, and of course awesome-ml.</p>

<hr>
<p>[1] The phenomenon of clickbait-y programming blogs from India is fascinating. What
were the cultural factors that caused such a proliferation of Indian blogs?</p>
<p>[2] The question I used was &ldquo;Can you describe the 5-10 libraries you most regularly
use for doing ML research and how they fit into your workflow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>[3] In practice, however, it seems like companies more or less use Kaggle as a recruiting platform; the solutions crafted by participants often don&rsquo;t translate well to actual use cases.</p>
