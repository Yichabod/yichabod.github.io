<p>There are dozens of different therapeutic modalities. I provide my opinion on a small subset of modalities, informed by two years of (nonprofessional) exploration. This may be helpful for people trying to navigate therapy or &lsquo;self-healing&rsquo; more generally.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p>Two years ago, in the midst of a personal crisis, I started taking ‘self-healing’ as a goal very seriously. I spent hundreds of hours reading about different approaches to therapy, trying techniques and taking notes on my experience. When I later consulted a therapist, I was introduced to techniques that required a trained practitioner, and also received some tacit confirmation of the hypotheses that I’d formed.</p>
<p>Months after I became obsessed, the crisis was dissolved. More than that, I began to unravel a tangled mass of suffering linked to my childhood. My sense of wellbeing significantly changed; my body and mind felt lighter, and my relationships, particularly with my family, began to improve.</p>
<p>Friends, after learning from my experience, have suggested I write down and share my thoughts more broadly. This document is in response to their prompt.</p>
<p>I’m not an expert, and this isn’t expert medical advice. Treat this as the opinionated account of some person on the internet who says he healed himself after hundreds of hours of various self-therapies. I’ve written it as ‘advice to my former self’, but I strongly encourage adopting a way of judging for yourself when interventions do/don’t work for you.</p>
<p>My hunch is that this post is most helpful not for my particular thoughts on therapy but rather the collection of therapies and resources I’ve put together.</p>

<h3 id="framing-thoughts">Framing thoughts</h3>
<p>Make sure you aren’t neglecting the three basic pillars of sleep, exercise, and regular eating (SEE)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sleep regularly</li>
<li>Start regularly exercising if you aren’t already
<ul>
<li>Seriously, exercise is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/40/5/1382/658632">absurdly important for general health</a>. Starting a regular exercise routine should be the first intervention.</li>
<li>For exercise advice, I like <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bZ2w99pEAeAbKnKqo/optimal-exercise">this post</a> and also Jerzy Gregorek’s <a href="https://thehappybody.com/">Happy Body</a> (which lacks scientific rigor but feels great)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eat regularly
<ul>
<li>I’m not talking about going on a diet, but just removing the stress from being hungry. Fasting can be great, but in my experience irregular eating does not help when your mind is under tension</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self-healing <em>will</em> be much easier when you aren’t neglecting any of these three factors. However, it is important to acknowledge that the (in)ability to consistently have healthy habits is closely entangled with the thing you are trying to heal. I suggest prioritizing these if possible / feels right</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have ongoing emotional difficulties, you will benefit most if you treat understanding and addressing mental health as seriously as you would take a PhD dissertation or full time job</p>
<ul>
<li>People could be a lot more disciplined in their approach to addressing their mental health. It’s clearly messy because many of the causes of a mental health crisis are often in direct tension with creating healthy habits, but I have found it very helpful to explicitly put mental health in a category of ‘important task’ that is on par with ‘PhD thesis’ or ‘job’ or ‘romantic relationship’. That is not to say that it will take the same amount of ‘work’ or effort as these tasks, but rather that it should be regarded as seriously as these other tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will often mean adopting daily habits for self healing</p>
<ul>
<li>What this looked like for me was an hour per day dedicated to trying a technique, taking notes about my experience, on top of doing background research on types of therapies.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, treat yourself with great kindness</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t have the space today to even begin processing emotions, that’s fine. Sometimes you</li>
<li>Know that you can witness significant changes with just a small amount of effort.</li>
<li>With the right approach, you can start to notice drastic differences in the course of a few sessions of practice. However, since progress is very hard to predict beforehand, it is quite helpful to ‘try not to expect any major change’</li>
</ul>
<p>If going with a therapist, you should talk to multiple to find a good fit</p>
<ul>
<li>I found that, at a minimum, talking to three different therapists was necessary to get a taste of the range of different competencies, attitudes, and personalities and how they affected treatment.</li>
<li>There is significant range in the competency of therapists. I have heard many anecdotes of unprofessional treatment among friends and family — I can say this most confidently of North America and New Zealand, but imagine that it broadly applies around the world.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, most therapists are not very good</li>
</ul>
<p>On paying for therapy</p>
<ul>
<li>You might feel nervous about spending money on therapy for a number of reasons:
<ul>
<li>It’s too expensive</li>
<li>It might take ‘too long’ to figure out whether it’s working</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It’s too expensive: Money is not worth worshiping on its own terms. A healthy attitude towards money is using it to make your life better. If you are in a state where therapy could significantly improve your life, sessions of effective therapy is one of the most powerful interventions you could take.
<ul>
<li>At the same time, it can be prohibitively expensive for a lot of people</li>
<li>There are many ways you can make big steps towards self healing — for instance, there are individuals (e.g. Coherence Therapy ‘coaches’) who are not trained therapists but who do have some training in certain modalities.</li>
<li>You can (and should) go very far with self-healing. Then approach therapists once you are ‘blocked’ and want to consult them on a particular issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It might take ‘too long’
<ul>
<li>Good therapies should reveal changes within a couple of sessions. Once you ‘feel the therapy’, you can be in a much better position to evaluate it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The quality of your therapist is very important, but so is the modality of therapy</p>
<ul>
<li>Common factors hypothesis (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_factors_theory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_factors_theory</a>)</li>
<li>See anecdotes of people who moved between different therapeutic modalities and experienced significant improvement</li>
</ul>
<p>‘Sensing therapies’<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> are much more effective than other therapies</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is mostly informed by my own experiments and my mental model of how therapy works<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By ‘sensing therapy’, I mean therapies that involve turning inwards in an attempt to directly be in and access emotional states. IFS, IPF, Coherence Therapy, Core Transformation, Focusing, are all examples of techniques or modalities that I would call ‘sensing’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is as opposed to rational detached analysis of the sort you find in psychoanalysis, and, to a lesser extent, in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beware of choosing a therapy that reinforces your coping strategy</p>
<ul>
<li>While you want a therapy that conforms to what you believe about the world, you want to make sure this therapy doesn’t simply serve as a tool to entrench you further into your existing beliefs.</li>
<li>Good self-healing should ‘stretch’ understanding of the past and present emotional terrain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="so-what-should-i-actually-do">So what should I actually do?</h3>
<p>Take different paths depending on your resources and the severity of your mental health.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you have time and mental energy, and your daily wellbeing is tolerable, it may make sense to spend a couple of months doing self-therapy and/or working with a peer.</p>
<p><em>Begin with Gendlin’s Focusing by listening to the audiobook and doing guided sessions for at least two weeks or until it clicks.</em></p>
<p>Focusing is the technique with the least scaffolding. I have found it to be the most broadly applicable skill in any form of introspection. After two weeks, you may begin to already feel a difference in your daily experience, even if not, you will at the least be much better equipped for the next methods.</p>
<p><em>Turn to another experiential framework that allows self-therapy.</em></p>
<p>Depending on your issue and what resonates, you can choose from Coherence Therapy, Internal Family Systems, Ideal Parenthood Figure protocol, Core Transformation.</p>
<p>I found early success with IFS. With each technique, I would estimate ~5-10 hours before you get the basics, then 50 hours before a lasting shift happens. If you’re spending an hour a day on this, that’s only ~7 weeks for a change that could carry through the rest of your life!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Stick with the same framework until it feels stale, and then a little more.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>If you are suffering a lot and you have the financial resources, it probably makes sense to immediately find a therapist.</p>
<pre><code>  \
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not equipped to give good advice about severe cases, but suggest the reader just choose a modality that fits with their worldview and start talking to someone (I’ve compiled a list of directories below). My favorite modalities have been Internal Family Systems and Coherence Therapy</p>
<p><em>Don’t focus on ‘getting healed’, but instead make space for some form of healing or check-in as part of your daily life.</em></p>
<p>After doing the practice for a few months, you can try decreasing the frequency of the practice, and notice how that feels.</p>

Also, you can see an introduction through inventor Diana Fosha’s <em>The Transforming Power of Affect</em>. But really, if you are intrigued by AEDP, you should just find a therapist that does AEDP-informed treatment.

<p>Research comparing therapies is abysmal, and most therapists don’t know how to compare or move between therapeutic modalities</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1978-08329-001">One</a> of the top cited papers I could find comparing therapies is from 1977 and uses 8(!) college students as the entire sample</li>
<li>My therapist told me firsthand how sad and disheartening it is that there is no good research on moving between therapeutic modalities</li>
<li>In an interview, Bruce Ecker (inventor of Coherence Therapy) gives an anecdote about how at a therapy conference he estimated that nearly half of the therapists present were in active distress about the broad range of different treatments</li>

<p>“However, what I learned through a few weeks of CBT, deconstructing every bad thought</p>
<p>and bad emotion, is that the frequency and intensity of bad emotions is not affected at all by reasoning. If anything, the thoughts that co-occurred with bad emotions got even more ridiculous. Without CBT, it might not have been clear that I had no control over the occurrence of bad emotions.” <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2022/09/07/the-limits-of-help/">Critique of CBT</a></p>
<h5 id="other-therapy-comparisons">Other therapy comparisons</h5>
<p>Adult attachment disturbances has a chapter assessing AEDP, EMDR, etc</p>
<p>There is a textbook that compares therapies, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/Kc_xoAEACAAJ?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiki_rvndH6AhUnBzQIHfM3DGkQre8FegQIFxAG">Theories of Psychotherapy and Counseling</a>. Unfortunately, it does not mention the majority of therapies that I find promising. It is a good detailed examination of pre-2000s therapies though.</p>
<p>“John Weisz, an eminent psychologist at Harvard, concluded that there were only five principles of treatment, irrespective of diagnosis. Using what he calls a “transdiagnostic approach,” Weisz’s principles for therapy are (a) feeling calm, such as through mindfulness, (b) increasing motivation, such as through incentives for good behavior, (c) repairing thoughts, such as with reframing bias in cognitive behavioral therapy, (d) solving problems through goal setting, and (e) trying the opposite, via exposure to overcome avoidance or behavioral activation for depression. The application of these principles does not depend on a DSM label or diagnostic code.” from Thomas Insel’s (former head of National Institute for Mental Health) <em>Healing: Our Path from Mental Illness to Mental Health.</em></p>
<p>Guilford has a chapter on his meta-protocol for treating patients <a href="https://www.guilford.com/excerpts/weisz2_ch1.pdf?t">here</a>. I will note that from personal experience I would say that Weisz’s protocol is missing “allowing the feeling to be there” as a step, and that “reframing bias” in the way that CBT does it is too head-y and not enough experienced in the body</p>
<p>A theory for why therapeutic modalities stop working over time. As some psychiatrists on the internet have observed, there seems to be a trend</p>

     My opinionated take
<p>
     (Fosha, 2009a, p.181)
<p>
     I’m referring more specifically to serotonergic hallucinogens (MDMA, psilocybin, LSD, ayahuasca, DMT,...). For a detailed review article that I defer to, see <a href="https://www.challiance.org/file%20library/landing%20pages/psych%20ce/meditation-and-psychotherapy/faculty-handouts/14_janis-phelps_saturday_145_handout-3.pdf">Garcia-Romeu & Richards (2018)</a>. In general, I know far less about psychedelic assisted therapy than the other forms I mention, but want to raise it as a possibility for some people.
