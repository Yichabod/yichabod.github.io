Hi Jane,

Please don't take the mustard from the refrigerator.

Intercept a normal email packet and you will see that every single field has been signed. If you look at a hotmail[^1] email packet, as my friend Aayush did, you'd find that the &quot;To&quot; field is unsigned. This means that it is theoretically possible to forward an email, changing the 'To' field. This makes it possible to make it appear that, the Amazon invoice for pink doilies was meant for manly_mike@gmail.com rather than jane@gmail.com.

But normal email clients don't let you send the raw packets. Instead, we had to find either an email service that allowed us to customize the email packets (apparently Amazon SES allows this) or else host our own emailing server.

Attempt 1: Amazon SES

This failed quickly. Although SES allows some level of email packet editing, it requires identity authentication and automatically signs the 'From' field. This means that we couldn't forward an intercepted email from someone else.

Attempt 2: Custom email server 1

Next, we considered running our own SMTP server using Postfix on an Amazon EC2 instance. That would provide us the freedom to manipulate email headers. Setting up Postfix was relatively straightforward, but we hit a roadblock - port 25, the default port for SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol - default email protocol), was blocked.

Attempt 3: Running our own SMTP server

We then installed Postfix on our Raspberry Pi to see if we could send customized packets using our own email server. As it turns out, Port 25 is blocked not just by AWS, but by the Internet Service Provider itself. Ports 465 and 587, which are sometimes also used for emails, were also blocked. Spoof failed.

In hindsight, it seemed pretty unlikely that we would succeed, even if hotmail was using a protocol that was somewhat out of date. sxqqdqxvsfuxd evlcuqmqfuuxf mfwhszwawiussvss cwgv.
