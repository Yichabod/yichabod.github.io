    <h1 id="on-david-chapmans-better-without-ai">On David Chapman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Better Without AI&rdquo;</h1>
<p>Loving David Chapman&rsquo;s latest book on AI risk. I’ve been thinking about this since 2017 and the book clarified a lot of confusion I had, particularly around how we conceive of AI (though I have some objections too). Thread: 1/</p>
<p>My favorite parts of the book:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“Agency” is a nebulous and confusing concept. Our discussions (e.g. the tool vs AI debate) are contentious because our intuitions are confused. It may be good to focus on the more concrete scenarios arising from current technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet &lsquo;agency’ can still be a useful lens. But rather than focusing on whether AI will be ‘tools’ or ‘agents’, it may be helpful to consider the space of agencies. For instance, what happens if we view AI as a ‘distributed agency’ like an ideology or an institution? 3/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AGI as a term is misleading for trying to understand risks; It’s power-seeking, not intelligence, that we should should be concerned about. (from
@jkcarlsmith
&rsquo;s paper)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since AGI is a muddled concept, discussions around “AGI timelines” are at best unhelpful, and often monger fear. (Though I think concrete predictions about AI capabilities are good and helpful to do)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “we rule chimpanzees because of our intelligence” line of argument is naive. For most of human history (Homo sapiens appeared ~300kya), we could not rule them. Neanderthals were plausibly more intelligent than us. The link between intelligence and power is unclear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One reason to be skeptical of transformative AI: &ldquo;Most of the doing of science is not reasoning; it is the physical work of experimentation. Therefore, superhuman intelligence might not speed progress much.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I was skeptical, however, of certain parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>His suggestion that AI is highly responsible for destroying collective sensemaking.  I think it’s clear that online social networks have contributed to polarization, but unclear how much recommender algorithms are responsible
8/</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, some of the biggest misinformation problems in Brazil (election misinfo) and India (sectarian violence / COVID misinfo) happened on WhatsApp, which has no recommender algorithm. eg <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/21/how-misinformation-whatsapp-led-deathly-mob-lynching-india/">https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/21/how-misinformation-whatsapp-led-deathly-mob-lynching-india/</a>…</p>
<p>“So far, we’ve accumulated a few dozen reasonably detailed, reasonably plausible bad scenarios. We’ve found zero that lead to good outcomes.” I think Chapman is stating his case a little too strongly here. If viewed as a general purpose technology, AI plausibly can lead to healthy growth by doing some valuable things that are hard to specify (kind of like electric motors in 1821 - it takes a while to figure out what it&rsquo;s good for).</p>
