<p><strong>Book thesis</strong>
Buddhism, as presented in the West (especially North America), is not so clearly a multi-thousand year old lineage of &lsquo;what the Buddha taught&rsquo; (as Walpola Rahula writes). Rather, it&rsquo;s an unusual product of the interaction between what Charles Taylor calls the &lsquo;discourses of modernity&rsquo; and specific kinds of traditional Buddhism.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-buddhist-modernism">What is Buddhist Modernism?</h5>
<p>The syncretic blend of Protestant, scientific rationalist, and romantic expressivist philosophy with traditional aspects of Buddhism.</p>
<p>In the common imagination, Buddhism (but really Buddhist modernism):</p>
<ul>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t require faith</li>
<li>Is about realizing compassion and peace through meditation</li>
<li>Is scientific</li>
<li>Is &ldquo;a philosophy, not a religion&rdquo;</li>
<li>Social work, democracy, equality core values</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;The formations of Buddhist modernism I have been using as case studies are ones that, even when they have been constructed by Japanese, Sri Lankans, Thais, or Tibetans, have tended to draw Buddhism into the orbit of western thought, rather than vice versa. Their particular kind of hybridity is often like that of Henry Steel Olcott’s, which, in Stephen Prothero’s interpretation, was a “creolization” that assimilated Buddhism to largely Protestant categories, assumptions, and logic. <strong>Like a creole dialect, its lexicon was Buddhist, while its grammar was largely Protestant</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-three-features-of-modernism-as-described-by-charles-taylor-in-_sources-of-the-self_-">What are the three features of modernism as described by Charles Taylor in <em>Sources of the Self</em> ?</h5>
<p><strong>Western monotheism</strong> - influences of Christianity especially in the wake of the protestant reformation (which led to an ethic of more hours worked, pro-market attitudes, individual as connection to god instead of church)</p>
<p><strong>Rationalism and scientific naturalism</strong> - a consequence of the European &lsquo;enlightenment&rsquo;. Scientific naturalism is the idea that laws of nature are all there is (naturalism) and can be tested through the scientific method. Rationalism (as first outlined by Descartes, Spinoza et al) is about the belief that truth lies in intellectual deductive processes rather than senses.</p>
<p><strong>Romantic expressivism</strong> - literary, artistic, and philosophical movement which arose as critique of the industrial revolution and increasing rationalism. American Transcendentalists (Emerson, Thoreau), Beats and Theosophists are the keystones of this movement. &ldquo;Nature and feeling are the sources of morality. There is such a thing as spiritual knowledge. We should seek the hidden depths within nature&rdquo;</p>
<h5 id="features-of-modernism">Features of modernism</h5>
<p>World affirming stance: &ldquo;meaning is not in another realm, but in the this life, everyday life, is lived.&rdquo;
<strong>Interiority, reflexivity, and self-scrutiny</strong>: &lsquo;truth found through mind&rsquo;s reasoning&rsquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Descartes dualism — all meaning is in mind. outer world is purely instrumental</li>
<li>Protestantism — God lies within; you don&rsquo;t need external authorities</li>
<li>Romanticism — morality, creativity, spirituality is present in each of our soul</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to acknowledge the diversity of modernisms.</p>
<h5 id="understanding-modernism-is-important-to-allow-oneself-to-escape-the-conceptual-box">Understanding modernism is important to allow oneself to escape the conceptual box</h5>
<p>We take for reality the notion that we &ldquo;act&rdquo;, &ldquo;reason&rdquo;, &ldquo;form beliefs&rdquo;, when really such a framing is highly culturally and historically idiosyncratic (specifically, a product of enlightenment rationalism).</p>
<h5 id="traditional-and-modernist-buddhists-are-very-different">Traditional and modernist Buddhists are very different</h5>
<p>Traditional Buddhists in Thailand, Vietnam, believe in supernatural spirits, giving donations (dana) to ensure rebirth in a greater realm. They defer to the authority of the sangha and of their teachers.
Buying sacred objects is a large business in many Buddhist countries.</p>
<p>Modernist Buddhists tend to be secular, liberal, have a large focus on meditation as practice. They are encouraged to adopt and reject whichever aspects of Buddhism appeal to them.</p>
<h5 id="buddhism-modernism-has-operated-in-line-with-what-weber-identified-as-the-disenchantment-of-the-world-similar-to-the-meaning-crisis">Buddhism modernism has operated in line with what Weber identified as the &lsquo;disenchantment of the world&rsquo; (similar to &lsquo;the meaning crisis&rsquo;)</h5>
<p>There is a continual sense of trying to reclaim what was lost.</p>
<h5 id="early-buddhist-reformers-had-to-make-buddhism-palatable-to-protestant-christianity">Early Buddhist reformers had to make Buddhism palatable to Protestant Christianity</h5>
<p>Sōen Shaku, early Zen reformer, provides a valuable case study. Careful to deny that Buddhism is athiestic, he claims that Buddhism &ldquo;certainly has a God, the highest reality and truth, through which this universe exists&rdquo; (p 67). He adopts western metaphysical language and paraphrases the bible.</p>
<p>Early translators (typically Christian missionaries) presented Buddhism as an aid to evangelizing Christianity (e.g. Edward Said). &ldquo;western powers studied the Orient in order to better subdue and control it&rdquo; (p70).</p>
<p>The early Buddhist modernizers resisted the explicit Christian framing of Buddhism, but in doing so drew on Protestant ideas to augment their stances.  &ldquo;mimetic forms the colonized developed in order to subvert the colonizers&rdquo;</p>
<h5 id="in-addition-to-scientific-rationalism-perennialism-was-also-strategically-adopted-by-buddhist-modernizers-to-enhance-the-appeal-of-buddhism">In addition to scientific rationalism, Perennialism was also strategically adopted by Buddhist Modernizers to enhance the appeal of Buddhism</h5>
<p>Perennialism: religions are all different paths pointing at the same Universal Truth. &ldquo;Advocates of this approach believed the means to this divine reality was serene contemplation and mystical experience&hellip; in which they saw Buddhism and Hinduism as specializing. This paradigm was a globalization of the earlier conception of the perennial philosophy (philosophia perennis)— the idea of a common set of truths held by all people in all times and places, first suggested in the sixteenth century by Augostino Steuco and developed by Leibniz. As it began to take shape in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it adopted a cosmology amalgamating Neoplatonism, German metaphysics, Buddhis, and the Vedanta school of Hinduism.&rdquo;
Transcendentalists, Aldous Huxley, etc were big fans. This later blended with the Theosophists.</p>
<p>Buddhist Modernizer playbook: &ldquo;[reverse] often implicit assumptino of Christian superiority that accompanied perennialism and [make] Buddhism the superior expression of the Universal Religion.&rdquo;
D.T. Suzuki&rsquo;s version of Zen is an excellent example of this. In <em>An Introduction to Zen Buddhism</em> (1949), he embraces the universality of mysticism while also calling Zen &ldquo;the ultimate fact of all philosophy and religion.&rdquo;</p>
<h5 id="romanticisms-effects-on-buddhism-embrace-the-voice-within-realize-that-all-is-one">Romanticism&rsquo;s effects on Buddhism: embrace the &lsquo;voice within&rsquo;, &lsquo;realize that all is one&rsquo;</h5>
<p>See Schiller, Hegel, Fichte etc</p>
<h5 id="key-figures-behind-buddhist-modernism">Key figures behind Buddhist modernism:</h5>
<p>Eastern figures: DT Suzuki, Fourteenth Dalai Lama. Angarika Dharmapala, Sōen Shaku
Western: John Kabat Zinn,</p>
<h5 id="moves-to-modernize-buddhism-demythologize-detraditionalize-psychologize">Moves to modernize Buddhism: demythologize, detraditionalize, psychologize</h5>
<p>Trungpa presented a reinterpretation of the six realms of rebirth in psychological terms (a novel move at the time)</p>
<h5 id="is-buddhism-scientific--a-sloppy-question">&lsquo;Is Buddhism scientific?&rsquo; — a sloppy question</h5>
<p>&ldquo;Both Buddhism and science are too complex and internally variegated for such reductions to be useful&rdquo;
Dalai Lama changed the Buddhist discourse by granting significant authority to science</p>
<p>Random fact: early adopters eg Dharmapala used colonial metaphors to suggest that that Buddhism was the appropriate religion &ldquo;for a civilized Aryan community&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the Semitic religions have neither psychology nor a scientific back ground.&rdquo; (Dharmapala 1965: 400).</p>
<h5 id="framing-buddhism-as-scientific-can-be-understood-as-a-rhetorical-move-by-the-early-buddhist-modernizers">Framing Buddhism as &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; can be understood as a rhetorical move by the early Buddhist modernizers</h5>
<p>There are many superstitious beliefs (karma, reincarnation, weather influence) that are core to how Buddhism has been practiced over the centuries. Some might say, &ldquo;but the core of the buddha&rsquo;s teachings are scientific&rdquo;</p>
<h5 id="interdependence-has-been-reinterpreted-and-is-now-used-to-oppose-the-renunciative-stance-that-formed-it">&lsquo;Interdependence&rsquo; has been reinterpreted and is now used to oppose the renunciative stance that formed it</h5>
<p>Interdependence, or &lsquo;dependent origination&rsquo;, is loosely the idea that we are all connected. As first introduced in the Pali suttas (the oldest Buddhist scriptures), it was used to point out the horrific tangle of <em>samsara</em> so that we could escape from it.</p>
<p>Later, when Buddhism was imported to China at around 1st Century AD, the South Asian renunciative worldview was in tension with the Daoist, nature-appreciating worldview in China. Reinterpretation, especially of the Avatamsaka Sutra by the Huayan school, is made to broaded the scope — the cosmic Buddha pervades all things and the universe and there is no need to escape interdependence but instead recognize it and embrace it.</p>
<p>Later on, after Schopenhauer laid the foundations for Romantic pantheism, Buddhist modernizers early in the 20th Century pointed to the Chan Buddhism embrace of the world while also embracing Romantic transcendentalism (love of purity of nature).  These transcendentalists were in turn reacting against the desacralizing worldview of nature by Francis Bacon and Renee Descartes.</p>
<p>Most recently, Buddhists like Thich Nhat Hanh, the Dalai Llama, but also westerners like Sharon Salzberg and Joanna Macy, have used interdependence as a motivation for social engagement (anti-war, directly helping alleviate the suffering of others) that would most probably seem foreign to those first reading the Pali Suttas.</p>
<p>But this doesn&rsquo;t really matter because the authenticity debate is fruitless. Religions are not static but evolve</p>
<p>p178: &ldquo;<em>The contemporary Buddhist ethic of interdependence, though it had occasional precedents in pre-modern Asian Buddhism, likely worked its way into contemporary Bud- dhist thought through remnants of the Romantic-Transcendentalist line of thinking that resonated with similar ideas in Huayen and Zen thought. In other words, this ethic was largely a potential implication of the traditional Buddhist doctrines of interdependence—an implication that was only developed into a fully articulated ethic in combination with the modern discourses of Romanticism-Transcendentalism and systems theory.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="to-further-explore">To further explore</h3>
<p>Buddhism was brought into China during the collapse of the Han dynasty. How did this happen, and how did this shape Buddhism? Is it generally true that societies in disarray are more open to new beliefs?</p>
