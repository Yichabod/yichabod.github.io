      <description>What is an institution? Introducing &amp;lsquo;A Grammar of Institutions&amp;rsquo; This is part of my series on Ostrom. You can also find the root page here.
&amp;lsquo;How should we define institutions?&#39;1 This is a difficult but surprisingly important question; at its core, traditional political science is about the study of institutions. Also, if we want to talk about governance, we need also a vocabulary to discuss the setting where governance takes place.</description>

      <description>This is a collection for the most important things I have learned from reading Elinor Ostrom. It is not comprehensive (for that you might turn to the Four Volume tome published by Lexington press). These are just some of the insights that I found most striking.
My plan for the series:
 What is an institution? Introducing &amp;lsquo;A Grammar&amp;rsquo; An overview of Institutional Analysis and Development Reflections on &amp;lsquo;Governing the Commons&amp;rsquo; &amp;hellip;(TBD)  </description>

Questions about Governance: A Primer Earlier on, I collected some key questions about economic growth. This page is my attempt to gather the key questions about governance.
As before, I found this exercise especially useful. I will also be using the descriptive/normative division to organize the questions.
A brief note before I get to the questions: as David Levi-Faur points out in the Oxford Handbook of Governance, &amp;lsquo;governance&amp;rsquo; has been introduced only very recently.</description>

      <description>What repositories do ML practitioners use most?: A review of surveys As part of my quest to find the most important machine learning repositories, I wanted to find the repos that are used most frequently.
This post is my attempt to gauge the most popular libraries using direct surveys of people who do some type of work with machine learning. I start with the public survey data I could find before going into the private survey I did.</description>

      <title>Why I&#39;m researching open source ML</title>

      <description>Why I&amp;rsquo;m researching open source ML The story I tell depends on whether I&amp;rsquo;m writing a grant or talking to a collaborator. The short honest reason I tell myself is that it&amp;rsquo;s fun and probably useful, which I&amp;rsquo;d contend are basically the two most useful criteria when making decisions about work.
It&amp;rsquo;s fun because I love trying new things.
It&amp;rsquo;s probably useful because open source ML is important yet neglected.</description>

      <description>Gorgeous Chemical Fires Note: you are one of a small number of people getting this update (because I care about you or else you are sasha chapin). Perhaps it should go without out saying but I request that you please don’t share this without asking beforehand. (Subnote: the original version of this was hosted on substack and I&amp;rsquo;ve repasted it here so all the links are missing)
As I start this letter, I am 10,000 meters above the ground, squeezed between two strangers with a polypropylene mask over my face.</description>

      <description>Governing the Decentralized Commons Taking a digital constitutionalism lens to Web3
Enoshima in Sagami Province, from the series &amp;ldquo;Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (富嶽三十六景)&amp;rdquo;
At the beginning of the Tokugawa shogunate (1600-1868), there were several agrarian villages in the Yamanashi prefecture. During the civil wars that led to the overthrow of the Ashikaga shogunate, vast swathes of land became commons — the open fields belonged to no feudal lord1.
Amid this free-for-all, some villagers began to take more than their due — reaping more rice crops than was sustainable, cutting down trees than could naturally regrow.</description>

Questions about Growth There is much ado about economic growth1. I wanted to better understand the debate, so I decided to collect the key questions. This essay is a breadth-first examination of growth and governance using questions
Why questioning instead of summarizing? Questioning requires understanding the intention of research in a way that summarizing does not.</description>
