Questions about Governance: A Primer Earlier on, I collected some key questions about economic growth. This page is my attempt to gather the key questions about governance.
As before, I found this exercise especially useful. I will also be using the descriptive/normative division to organize the questions.
A brief note before I get to the questions: as David Levi-Faur points out in the Oxford Handbook of Governance, &amp;lsquo;governance&amp;rsquo; has been introduced only very recently.</description>

Questions about Growth There is much ado about economic growth1. I wanted to better understand the debate, so I decided to collect the key questions. This essay is a breadth-first examination of growth and governance using questions
Why questioning instead of summarizing?
Questioning requires understanding the intention of research in a way that summarizing does not.</description>

      <description>What is an institution? Introducing Ostrom&amp;rsquo;s institutional grammar This is part of my series on Ostrom. You can also find the root page here.
&amp;lsquo;How should we define institutions?&#39;[1] This is a difficult but surprisingly important question; at its core, traditional political science is about the study of institutions. Also, if we want to talk about governance, we need also a vocabulary to discuss the setting where governance takes place. Questions like &amp;ldquo;most open source software repositories are governed democratically&amp;rdquo; remain painfully vague without a precise vocabulary.</description>

      <title>Why I&#39;m researching open source ML</title>

      <description>Why I&amp;rsquo;m researching open source ML The story I tell depends on whether I&amp;rsquo;m writing a grant or talking to a collaborator. The short honest reason I tell myself is that it&amp;rsquo;s fun and probably useful, which I&amp;rsquo;d contend are basically the two most useful criteria when making decisions about work.
It&amp;rsquo;s fun because I love trying new things.
It&amp;rsquo;s probably useful because open source ML is important yet neglected.</description>
