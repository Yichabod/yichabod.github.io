Questions about Growth There is much ado about economic growth1. I wanted to better understand the debate, so I decided to collect the key questions. This essay is a breadth-first examination of growth and governance using questions
Why questioning instead of summarizing?
Questioning requires understanding the intention of research in a way that summarizing does not.</description>

      <description>What repositories do ML practitioners use most?: A review of surveys As part of my quest to find the most important machine learning repositories, I wanted to find the repos that are used most frequently.
This post is my attempt to gauge the most popular libraries using direct surveys of people who do some type of work with machine learning. I start with the public survey data I could find before going into the private survey I did.</description>

      <description>Why I&amp;rsquo;m researching open source ML The story I tell depends on whether I&amp;rsquo;m writing a grant or talking to a collaborator. The short honest reason I tell myself is that it&amp;rsquo;s fun and probably useful, which I&amp;rsquo;d contend are basically the two most useful criteria when making decisions about work.
It&amp;rsquo;s fun because I love trying new things.
It&amp;rsquo;s probably useful because open source ML (which you will see me use interchangeably with open source AI — sticklers please forgive me) is important yet neglected.</description>
