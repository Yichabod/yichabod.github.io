      <description>What is an institution? Introducing &amp;lsquo;A Grammar of Institutions&amp;rsquo; This is part of my series on Ostrom. You can also find the root page here.
&amp;lsquo;How should we define institutions?&#39;[1] This is a difficult but surprisingly important question; at its core, traditional political science is about the study of institutions. Also, if we want to talk about governance, we need also a vocabulary to discuss the setting where governance takes place.</description>

      <description>This is a collection for the most important things I have learned from reading Elinor Ostrom. It is not comprehensive (for that you might turn to the Four Volume tome published by Lexington press). These are just some of the insights that I found most striking.
My plan for the series:
 What is an institution? Introducing &amp;lsquo;A Grammar&amp;rsquo; An overview of Institutional Analysis and Development Reflections on &amp;lsquo;Governing the Commons&amp;rsquo; &amp;hellip;(TBD)  </description>

Questions about Governance: A Primer Earlier on, I collected some key questions about economic growth. This page is my attempt to gather the key questions about governance.
As before, I found this exercise especially useful. I will also be using the descriptive/normative division to organize the questions.
A brief note before I get to the questions: as David Levi-Faur points out in the Oxford Handbook of Governance, &amp;lsquo;governance&amp;rsquo; has been introduced only very recently.</description>

Questions about Growth There is much ado about economic growth1. I wanted to better understand the debate, so I decided to collect the key questions. This essay is a breadth-first examination of growth and governance using questions
Why questioning instead of summarizing?
Questioning requires understanding the intention of research in a way that summarizing does not.</description>

      <title>Why I&#39;m researching open source ML</title>

      <description>Why I&amp;rsquo;m researching open source ML The story I tell depends on whether I&amp;rsquo;m writing a grant or talking to a collaborator. The short honest reason I tell myself is that it&amp;rsquo;s fun and probably useful, which I&amp;rsquo;d contend are basically the two most useful criteria when making decisions about work.
It&amp;rsquo;s fun because I love trying new things.
It&amp;rsquo;s probably useful because open source ML is important yet neglected.</description>
